# Kevok Community

## About

Welcome to Kevok Community! We are a passionate group of individuals enthusiastic about software development, technology, and open-source projects. Our primary objective is to foster knowledge-sharing, collaborate on projects, and facilitate community engagement, particularly focusing on the Kurdish language.

## How to Contribute

At the moment, there are no ongoing projects available for contribution within the Kevok community. However, we have several exciting projects in the pipeline:

1. **Kevok Forum:** A social community project.
2. **Kevok Translate:** A platform to discover, support, and contribute to projects utilizing or intending to utilize the Kurdish language.
3. **Kevok Language:** A comprehensive language course for Kurdish.

Stay tuned for updates on these projects!
